# Student Percentage Prediction
Predicts percentage of students.

## Objective
Use machine learning to create a model that predicts the percentage of student on the basis of hours they studied.

## About Dataset
***Training set includes 24 records and 2 attributes.

The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. The test data should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data.
#### Variable Note
* ***Hours:*** Number of hours student studied for.

* ***Score:*** Marks obtained by the student.
